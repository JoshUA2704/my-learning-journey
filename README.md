## 🌟 My Learning Journey

## 👋 About Me
Hello! My name is [ayodele joshua]. I’m currently learning technology at **Hamzatronic Technologies**. I’m still new to computers, but I’m determined to grow and improve every day. I believe that learning how to build things with code is a powerful skill, and I’m excited to be on this journey.

##  What I'm Learning
So far, I have learned the following things:
- How to create a **simple website** using HTML
- How to design the website using **CSS**
- How to organize files inside folders properly
- How to use **Git and GitHub** to save my work online
- How to make commits and push changes to GitHub

##  What I Understand So Far
- HTML is used to **structure** a webpage. It creates the headings, paragraphs, buttons, and so on.
- CSS is used to **style** the page – it changes the colors, background, fonts, and layout.
- Git helps me **save versions** of my work.
- GitHub is like an **online backpack** where I keep my project safe and share it with others.

## 💻 About This Project
In this project:
- I created a simple web page using HTML.
- I styled the page using a separate CSS file.
- I wrote this README to explain what I’ve learned.
- I used Git to track my progress.
- I pushed my work to GitHub.

## 📈 My Goals
I want to:
- Be able to create more advanced websites
- Learn how to make pages interactive with JavaScript
- Understand how websites work behind the scenes
- Build real-world projects to show what I can do
- Get better and more confident with computers

## 🙏 Thank You
Big thanks to my mentors and classmates at **Hamzatronic Technologies** for guiding and supporting me through my journey. I’m proud of my progress and I know I will keep getting better!
